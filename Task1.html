                12 Angry Men is a classic 1957 American legal drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and based on Reginald
                Rose's 1954 teleplay,
                depicting a jury of twelve men deliberating the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murder in
                New York City.
                Set almost entirely within a single jury room on a hot summer day, the film explores themes of
                prejudice, justice,
                and the concept of reasonable doubt as the jurors confront their biases and strive for a unanimous
                verdict.

                "Lion of the Desert" primarily refers to Omar Mukhtar, a Libyan tribal leader who led the Bedouin
                resistance against the Italian colonization of Libya during the Second Italo-Senussi War in the early
                20th century. He is depicted in the 1981 epic historical war film Lion of the Desert, starring Anthony
                Quinn as Mukhtar and directed by Moustapha Akkad, which portrays his heroic defiance against the Italian
                army and its cruel tactics.
                In summary, "Lion of the Desert" is a title and a film that memorializes Omar Mukhtar, a pivotal figure
                in Libyan history who led the resistance against Italian occupation.
